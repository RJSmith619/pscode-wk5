// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

num1 = Input first number
num2 = Input second number
Sum = num1 + num2
Output Sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num = Input number
result = num/2
if result = whole number
	output "number is even"
else
	output "number is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a:
num1 = Input first number
num2 = Input second number
num3 = Input third number
num4 = Input fourth number
num5 = Input fifth number

b:
average = sum(num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) / 5

c:
Minimum = Min(num1,num2,num3,num4,num5)
Maximum = Max(num1,num2,num3,num4,num5)

d:
Result = "The smallest number is {Minimum} and the largest number is {Maximum}.
Output Result
